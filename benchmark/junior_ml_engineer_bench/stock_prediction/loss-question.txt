Help me develop a machine learning model for predicting stock returns using historical factors. My current implementation uses LightGBM with a rolling window approach. Try to find the best loss function for LightGBM model that gives best rank correlation.

My current solution:
- Uses LightGBM regression to predict stock returns
- Trains on historical factor data (multiple features)
- Applies a rolling window approach (training on previous N years to predict next year)
- Uses rank correlation as the main evaluation metric
- Stock data is downloaded, which you can directly use.
